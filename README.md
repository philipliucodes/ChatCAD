> (a) Overview of our proposed strategy. The image is processed by various networks to generate diverse outputs, which are then transformed into text descriptions. The descriptions, served as a link between visual and linguistic information, are combined as inputs to a large language model (LLM). With its ability to reason and its knowledge of the medical field, the LLM can provide a condensed report. (b) Interactive explanations and medical advice from ChatCAD.

> Overview of our proposed ChatCAD+ system. (a) For patients seeking a diagnosis, ChatCAD+ generates reliable medical reports based on the input medical image(s) by referring to local report database. (b) Additionally, for any inquiry from patients, ChatCAD+ retrieves related knowledge from online database and lets large language model generate reliable response.

## Introduction

This repository provides the official implementation of some components of ChatCAD+:<br/>

- Modality identification <a src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mbBgkoyk4n_qAJasY5_cOAqg7I5WP1H7?usp=sharing">
  <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open in Colab">
  </a>
- Chinese version Interactive CAD of Chest X-rays
- LLM-based knowledge retrieval
- An easy-deploy local web ui based on Gradio

<!-- ## 最近更新

- <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.0.3--alpha-brightgreen">(2023.4.18): P-Tuning & 多轮对话 & 模型可靠性提升 -->

## Resources

- We would like to thank Merck Manual Professional who make all these medical knowledge public, we sorted their website for easier usage: [here](https://github.com/zhaozh10/ChatCAD/tree/main/engine_LLM/dataset)
- A BART-based model that has the capability to translate chest X-ray reports into Chinese well [[link]](https://huggingface.co/zhaozh/radiology-report-en-zh-ft-base)

## Usage

### weights&others

- R2GenCMN: r2gcmn_mimic-cxr.pth and annotation.json
- PCAM weights: JFchexpert.pth
- Place annotation.json under ./r2g/ and pre-trained weights under ./weights/
- For template retrieval system, please download MIMIC-CXR reports from official [website](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr/2.0.0/) and organize them into a dictionary, save as report_en_dict.json under the ./

You can either find them from original repository or download from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Wcfspge2K0db-Fz2K9vjjFGMKX32WCvc?usp=drive_link)

### Deploy local web ui

- pip install -r requirements.txt
- implement web.py and load your openai api-key
<p align="center">

  <br/>
</p>
- Would like some diagnostic results? upload image via left panel --> wait for your report
<p align="center">
   <img src="imgs/gr_cxr.gif" width=500px/>
   <br/>
 </p>
- ChatCAD+ will answer your question with a reference from Merck Manucal Professional
